Graph 01:
	The first graph was created based around the question: what are the top 3 bacteria that need the most concentration of Penicillin?  The answer (Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) can be found using a standard bar graph to organize the data.  The document encodings used for the bar graph are: position along a common scale and length.

	Position along a common scale allows the bars to have context as to how much concentration is needed, and length is used to allow for comparison between the graphs by their heights.  Both of these helps the viewer to find which bars are higher in values.  They help communicate which bacteria uses the most concentration of Penicillin.

Graph 02:
	The second graph was created based around the question: out of the 16 bacteria, were there more positive or negative reactions to gram staining?  The answer (more negative reactions) can be found easily using a stacked bar chart.  The document encodings used for the stacked bar chart are: position along a common scale, position along a nonaligned scale, length, and color.  As with other bar graphs, a common scale gives numeric values that allows for comparing the numeric values of the bars and length gives a way of comparison between the two sets of data, but the biggest impactful encodings are the others that are mentioned.

	Position along a nonaligned scale really helps with communicating which bar has a higher value than the other.  Color assists in this with the separated bars.  It helps to visually divide the bars.  The taller bar clearly has a larger value than the shorter bar.

Graph 03:
	The third graph was created based around the question: of all the antibiotics, which one needed the most concentration to prevent growth in vitro for the listed bacteria?  The answer (Penicilin) is found by comparing the data through a grouped bar chart.  The document encodings used for the grouped bar chart are: position along a common scale, length, and color.  All these help in effectively communicating the chart.

	Position along a common scale gives the bars a way to compare each other.  Viewers can follow the position of the bar to the scale to estimate the value.  And because of grouping, viewers can understand that one group of bars pertains to one bacteria.  Although position along a common scale helps determine which bar is greater than the next, because value isnâ€™t as important, length and color are what really helps in the communication of the chart.

	The lengths of the bars help with the comparison of which bar is greater.  It is obvious that the longer bars are greater than the shorter bars.  Colors are used to divide the bars into different categories.  This helps with perceptual processing by implying that each bar represents a different category, which allows for comparison with each other. 

Overall, I used bar graphs that use position along a common scale because it is at the top for the most accurate elementary task.  Other graphs and elementary tasks did not seem effective into answering the questions on their own.  By mixing different tasks, I pushed for more effectiveness.
